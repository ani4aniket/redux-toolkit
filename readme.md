## Purpose:
The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
  - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
  - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
  - "[[Redux]] requires too much boilerplate code"
